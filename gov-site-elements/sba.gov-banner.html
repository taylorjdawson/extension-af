                Senate Democrats voted to block a clean federal funding bill
                (H.R. 5371), leading to a government shutdown that is preventing
                the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) from serving
                Americaâ€™s 36 million small businesses.
              </p>
              <p class="margin-y-1">
                Every day that Senate Democrats continue to oppose a clean
                funding bill, they are stopping an estimated 320 small
                businesses from accessing $170 million in SBA-guaranteed
                funding.
              </p>
              <p class="margin-y-1">
                As a result of the shutdown, we wanted to notify you that many
                of our services supporting small businesses are currently
                unavailable. The agency is executing its Lapse Plan and as soon
                as the shutdown is over, we are prepared to immediately return
                to the record-breaking services we were providing under the
                leadership of the Trump Administration.
